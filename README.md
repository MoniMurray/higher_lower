# 'Higher Lower' - A Game of Chance!

Higher Lower is an interactive, fully responsive game of chance.

The game will generate 5 random numbers between 1-20.  A user must sign-in to play the game.  The user is welcomed, and the first number of 5 is displayed.  The user must guess whether each consecutive number is Higher or Lower than the previous number.  The numbers will be kept hidden from the user until they select either the Higher/Lower button to guess the outcome of that number. The game will continue until either all 5 numbers have been correctly guessed, or an incorrect guess ends the game.

The user's score is counted and the Correct Answer score is displayed under the game area.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
